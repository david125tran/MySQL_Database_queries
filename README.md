# SQL_queries

This is some of my SQL work that I have worked on through MySQL.

***IG_clone_data.sql***
This is a project I worked on by being guided through a Udemy course

***BJJ_tourney_clone_data.sql***
This is a project I worked on independently.  I love Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and so I made created a mock version of a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournament database schema design to showcase me performing different SQL queries. 

***Dance_data.sql***
This is a project I worked on independently.  I created a mock dance database design schema of a dance competition to showcase me performing different SQL queries.
